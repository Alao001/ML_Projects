# Aim of The Project

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, understanding salary trends for software developers is crucial for both professionals and organizations. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict software developer salaries based on various factors such as experience, location, skills, and company size.

By accurately predicting salaries, we can gain valuable insights into the job market, identify trends, and assist developers in making informed career decisions. The model utilizes Random Forest to analyze a comprehensive dataset of software developer profiles and their corresponding salaries.

# About The Dataset

The dataset was the survey conducted by Stack overflow in May 2024,where over 65,000 developers responded to the annual survey about coding, the technologies and tools they use and want to learn, AI, and developer experience at work.
